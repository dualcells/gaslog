# gaslog
A simple sql database to track distance and fuel over time.

## Requirements
1. sqlite3
  * Perhaps you might like DB Browser for SQLite http://sqlitebrowser.org/
2. Your own data;
  * Write your odometer reading on your gas receipt.

## Examples

!["Graph of total price per fill-up"](https://github.com/dualcells/gaslog/blob/master/samples/plot_cost_date.png "Graph of total price per fill-up")

!["Graph of odometer readings over time"](https://github.com/dualcells/gaslog/blob/master/samples/plot_dist_date.png "Graph of odometer readings over time")

!["Graph of total litres per fill-up"](https://github.com/dualcells/gaslog/blob/master/samples/plot_fill_date.png "Graph of total litres per fill-up")

### TODO:
  * Add python scripts to create graphs.
  * Add select statement to show distance travelled per interval.
